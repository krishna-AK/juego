--------------------------------------------------------------------------
App should contain the following activities.
	1) Login activity
	2) Register activity
	3) Game activity(should contain a dynamic user dashboard)
	4) Recharge activity
	5) withdraw activity
	6) order history activity
	
-> APP starts off with login activity
-> user places the credentials and sends a http request to "/api/login"
-> It responds with a secret token if valid credentials
-> We need to store this token in memory through out the process runtime

->	APP then proceeds to the game activity, this is where all the game data is displayed
->  To place a bet on the current item we need to query bet_id at "/api/current_item_id"
->	We can update the timer by querying "/api/get_timer"
->	Query user balance at "/api/balance"
->	In a specified time-slot user places a bet at "/api/order"
->	After collecting all the valid requests server processes them and declares a winner and updates the database(expected time < 500ms for 10k users)
->	User can view all his orders at "/api/myorders"(In a new layout)



SOME GOOD PRACTICES:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
->	Store user authentication token in a global static variable
->	In the beginning create a coroutine(using threads) which updates 'timer' and 'balance' at regular intervals (or) whenever a new request is made
->	please define clear-cut procedures for every thing.
->	USE APPROPRIATE VARIABLE NAMES!
